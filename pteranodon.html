      <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
      <p>Pteranodons had long, toothless beaks and large wingspans, some of which were larger than modern-day aircraft. Their wings were similar to those of modern-day birds, and their bodies were lightweight, allowing them to soar effortlessly through the skies. They likely spent much of their time over water, feeding on fish.</p>
