      <h2>ðŸŽ¬ In Jurassic Park</h2>
      <p>In the Jurassic Park franchise, T. rex plays a central role as both a fearsome threat and a symbol of nature's power. It first appears as the park's main attraction, but it soon becomes a terrifying force when the parkâ€™s security fails.</p>
      <p>The T. rex is also central to the park's escape narrative, particularly in the 1993 movie where it rescues the protagonists from the Velociraptors. Its appearance is unforgettable, with a terrifying roar and an iconic chase scene.</p>
