      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Spinosaurus is a massive carnivorous dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous period, around 112 to 93 million years ago. It is known for its distinctive sail-like structure along its back and its semi-aquatic lifestyle, making it one of the most unique and mysterious dinosaurs of the Mesozoic era.</p>

      <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
      <p>Spinosaurus could reach up to 59 feet in length and weigh around 7 to 10 tons. It had a long, crocodile-like snout, which helped it hunt fish and other aquatic prey. Its most distinguishing feature was the large sail on its back, which might have been used for temperature regulation or as a display to attract mates.</p>

      <h2>In Jurassic Park III</h2>
      <p>In *Jurassic Park III* (2001), Spinosaurus is portrayed as a fearsome and dominant predator. It is shown as more agile and aggressive than the Tyrannosaurus Rex, taking on and defeating the T. rex in a dramatic battle. This portrayal of Spinosaurus as the new apex predator of Isla Sorna was one of the key plot elements of the film.</p>
