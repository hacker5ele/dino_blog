      <h2>Key Differences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Characters:</strong> In the movie, characters like John Hammond are portrayed as more sympathetic, while in the book, he is shown as more of an arrogant businessman. Dr. Gennaro is another character who has a significant difference in portrayal; in the book, heâ€™s portrayed as more cowardly, but in the movie, he becomes more heroic.</li>
        <li><strong>Tone:</strong> The novel is much darker, delving into complex themes of scientific ethics, chaos theory, and genetic manipulation. The film, while still carrying these themes, tends to focus more on thrilling action sequences and suspense, making it more of a blockbuster experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Events:</strong> There are several key events in the book that donâ€™t make it into the movie, such as the famous river raft escape scene, where characters must navigate a perilous river while being attacked by a group of raptors. This scene, while intense, was omitted from the movie, which streamlined the plot to focus on the core survival story.</li>
        <li><strong>Dino Behavior:</strong> The book delves much deeper into the behavior of the dinosaurs, describing them with more scientific accuracy. The raptors, for example, are portrayed as more intelligent and calculating in the book, displaying behaviors based on the latest scientific understanding at the time, whereas the film took a bit more creative liberty with their intelligence and portrayal as pure predators.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why the Differences Matter</h2>
      <p>
        While the differences between Michael Crichtonâ€™s *Jurassic Park* and Spielbergâ€™s adaptation might seem trivial at first glance, they reveal two very different approaches to storytelling. The book is a detailed exploration of the ethical issues surrounding genetic engineering and the dangers of human intervention in nature. Crichtonâ€™s characters wrestle with these questions in complex ways, and the story has a much darker, almost cautionary tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spielbergâ€™s movie, on the other hand, focuses on the spectacle of dinosaurs and the emotional journey of the characters. The filmâ€™s action-packed sequences, such as the T. rex escape and the raptors in the kitchen, are what people most remember. Spielberg smartly condenses the more complex elements of the novel to maintain a fast-paced narrative, while still keeping the heart of Crichtonâ€™s story intact.

      <h2>Impact on Pop Culture</h2>
      <p>
        The success of Spielbergâ€™s *Jurassic Park* movie was immense, and it solidified the concept of dinosaurs in pop culture. While the book was already popular, it was the movie that truly brought the story into the public consciousness. Spielbergâ€™s innovative use of CGI to bring dinosaurs to life was groundbreaking at the time and raised the bar for future films. The filmâ€™s success also sparked a series of sequels, making it a cultural phenomenon that continues to shape the portrayal of dinosaurs in media today.
      </p>
      <p>
        While some fans of the novel prefer its darker, more thoughtful narrative, the movie remains one of the most beloved blockbusters in history. It created a lasting impact on film technology, special effects, and how stories are adapted from page to screen.
