      <h2>Jurassic World (2015)</h2>
      <p>
        Directed by Colin Trevorrow, the fourth film in the franchise resurrects the Jurassic Park concept with a fully operational Jurassic World theme park. When the park’s new genetically-engineered hybrid, the Indominus Rex, escapes containment, chaos ensues. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Themes:</strong> This film revisits the consequences of playing with nature, echoing the original's central message. However, it also touches on the commodification of the dinosaurs as entertainment. It also explores the nature of corporate greed with the InGen company’s focus on profit over ethics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legacy:</strong> Jurassic World reintroduced the franchise to a new generation, breaking box office records and revitalizing the series. Chris Pratt’s role as Owen Grady and Bryce Dallas Howard’s Claire Dearing marked a new direction for the saga.

      <h2>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)</h2>
      <p>
        Directed by J.A. Bayona, Fallen Kingdom picks up three years after Jurassic World’s destruction. The story revolves around a rescue mission to save the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar before a volcanic eruption wipes them out. However, things take a dark turn when the dinosaurs are auctioned off to the highest bidder, creating an ethical dilemma about saving these creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Themes:</strong> The movie dives into the consequences of cloning, animal rights, and the morality of exploiting creatures for profit. The ethical questions surrounding genetic engineering are central to the film’s plot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legacy:</strong> Although it didn’t perform as strongly as its predecessor in terms of critical reception, Fallen Kingdom helped expand the world outside the island and set the stage for the next chapter in the saga, leading to the 'dinosaur in the world' concept explored in Dominion.

      <h2>Jurassic World: Dominion (2022)</h2>
      <p>
        Directed again by Colin Trevorrow, Dominion is the epic conclusion to the Jurassic World trilogy. With dinosaurs now integrated into the world’s ecosystems, the story explores the consequences of this new reality, as well as the return of legacy characters like Dr. Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcolm. Together with Owen and Claire, they must stop a corporate conspiracy that threatens both human and dinosaur life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Themes:</strong> Dominion explores genetic ethics, human intervention in nature, and the ongoing fight between corporate power and conservation. The film’s message touches on humanity's responsibility to protect both nature and the creatures they’ve unleashed. It also showcases the struggle for balance between coexistence and exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legacy:</strong> Dominion has mixed critical reception. While it was praised for bringing together the old and new characters, and for showcasing new dinosaur species, it also drew criticism for its convoluted plot. Nonetheless, it closes the chapter on the Jurassic World saga and leaves the door open for future stories.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Jurassic World trilogy was a daring new phase for the franchise, one that took the concepts of chaos theory, genetic experimentation, and the moral consequences of human ambition and gave them a modern twist. The trilogy explored how humanity’s relationship with dinosaurs evolved from entertainment to a global crisis, and it did so with a mix of heart-pounding action and deep philosophical questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        While each installment brought something unique, the trilogy's overall legacy is built on the tension between humanity’s desire to control nature and the unpredictable, chaotic results of such ambition.
