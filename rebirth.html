      <p>
        The rumors of a new Jurassic World film, tentatively called "Rebirth," have been circulating ever since the conclusion of "Jurassic World: Dominion." There‚Äôs a growing buzz that the film could either mark a full reboot of the franchise or continue the story in an entirely new timeline. Many fans are hoping for a fresh perspective, moving away from the established island themes and exploring new territories for the dinosaurs to roam.

      <h2>Possible Plot Directions</h2>
      <p>Though nothing is confirmed, fans are wildly speculating on what ‚ÄúRebirth‚Äù could focus on. Some ideas include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Post-Dominion World:</strong> After the events of "Dominion," dinosaurs live alongside humanity in the modern world. This could bring about environmental and political challenges, as dinosaurs face extinction once again in a human-dominated planet.</li>
        <li><strong>New Genetics and Hybrid Creatures:</strong> Could the future of genetic manipulation take a darker turn? New hybrids, or even better control over the dinosaurs, could make for an exciting plotline that delves into corporate espionage and genetic warfare.</li>
